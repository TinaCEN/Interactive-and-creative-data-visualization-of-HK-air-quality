# ðŸŒ† Interactive Hong Kong Air Quality Visualization (1993-2023) ðŸŽ¨

An interactive data art piece visualizing 30 years of Hong Kong air quality data with creative visual effects and mouse interactions.

## âœ¨ Features

### ðŸ“Š Data Visualization
- **30-year timeline** (1993-2023) of Hong Kong air quality
- **District-based heat map** with AQI color coding
- **Interactive timeline** with clickable year navigation
- **Real-time statistics panel** showing trends and comparisons

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Controls
- **Mouse hover effects**: Ripples, particles, and trails follow your cursor
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - `S`: Toggle detailed statistics panel
  - `R`: Rainbow trail mode on/off
  - `E`: Create particle explosions
  - `W`: Trigger weather effects (fog/rain based on AQI)
  - `C`: Clear all special effects

### ðŸŽ† Creative Visual Effects
- **Particle explosion system** with physics-based animations
- **Data sparkles** that reflect air quality levels
- **Weather simulation** (fog for pollution, rain for clean air)
- **Rainbow trail mode** for artistic visualization
- **Multi-layered particle systems** with depth effects

### ðŸ“ˆ Data Analysis Features
- **Best/worst year comparisons**
- **30-year trend analysis**
- **Mode indicators** for current visualization state
- **AQI-based color mapping** for intuitive understanding

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pygame numpy pandas requests
```

### Run the Visualization
```bash
python hk_air_quality_super_enhanced.py
```
